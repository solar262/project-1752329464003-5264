Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to create this auto-activated email sender using a stack of emails where each one automatically links back to the previous one. So, first, I need to understand the structure they want. It's like a chain where each link activates the next, but without any separate buttons or toggles.

I think about how email clients usually handle this. When you click the send button on an email, it should trigger all the following emails in the chain. But if there are too many links, manually setting up each email might be tedious and error-prone. That's probably why they want a stack of emails that can be auto-activated.

So, I need to create multiple email addresses where each one points to the next. Maybe start with just two links and then see how it scales if needed. Each email should have a subject line so users know what's being sent.

I'm thinking about using a simple HTML structure for the emails. Each email can be in a separate list, and the body of each email will link to the next one. Then, I'll set up an anchor tag that automatically moves down when clicked.

Wait, but how do I handle multiple links without making them all the same? Maybe each email should have its own ID so they can be tracked separately. But in HTML, it's easier to just list them out and link each to the next one.

I also need to consider how this works with different email clients. For example, Gmail, Outlook, or Outlook 365. Each has its own way of opening links from an address. So, I might need to write code that sends the click event when a link is clicked and then moves it down to trigger the next email.

But wait, if this is just a static HTML file without any JavaScript, would it work? I think yes, but browsers can't handle multiple clicks at once for emails unless there's some plugin or library. Maybe adding a plugin like Eau Claire could help here.

Alternatively, using an email client as the backend might be more straightforward, especially if they need real-time communication and automatic activation without HTML complexity.

I'm also thinking about how to make this scalable. If the number of links increases, it's easy to add new emails, but if someone tries to set up too many, it could become confusing. Maybe include a way to reset or remove links at any time.

Testing is another thing. I need to check that clicking on an email in the list activates all following ones and that each link actually works when clicked. Also, ensuring that the anchor tag moves down correctly after each click without getting stuck or not triggering the next email.

Oh, and perhaps including a confirmation message before sending the final email would be good. Maybe a button to prompt the user to check their recipient list.

I'm also considering if there's any backend needed for sending emails automatically. If it's just a static setup, maybe an API could handle it, but that might complicate things more than necessary.

Finally, I should outline the steps clearly: start with two links, build up as needed, handle different email clients via appropriate plugins or scripts, test thoroughly, and include any additional features like a confirmation message or reset functionality.

To create an auto-activated email sender using HTML, follow these organized steps:

1. **HTML Structure Setup**:
   - Create multiple email addresses in separate lists.
   - Each list will contain an email address that links to the next one.

2. **Email Content**:
   - Include a subject line for each email to inform recipients immediately.

3. **Linking Emails**:
   - Use `href` attributes or anchor tags to link each email to the next in the chain.
   - Ensure each email has its own list ID or unique identifier.

4. **HTML Example**:

```html
<div class="emails">
    <div class="email-list">
        <span>Subject 1</span>
        <p>Email content here.</p>
        <a href="/send-1">Send to Email List 1</a>
        <a href="/send-2">Send automatically to Email List 2</a>
        <a href="/send-3">Send automatically to Email List 3</a>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="emails">
    <div class="email-list">
        <span>Subject 2</span>
        <p>Email content here.</p>
        <a href="/send-4">Send to Email List 1</a>
        <a href="/send-5">Send automatically to Email List 2</a>
        <a href="/send-6">Send automatically to Email List 3</a>
    </div>
</div>

<!-- Continue with additional emails -->
```

5. **JavaScript/HTML Integration**:
   - Add a JavaScript function that triggers clicks on each email link.
   - Use the `click` event handler in HTML anchor tags or `<script>` tags.

6. **Link Activation**:
   - When an email is clicked, use your JavaScript to open all following links.
   - Ensure each click moves the next link down without conflicts.

7. **Email Client Compatibility**:
   - If using a specific email client like Gmail or Outlook, set up your HTML as part of their setup.
   - If necessary, use plugins like Eau Claire for automatic opening functionality.

8. **Testing**:
   - Test each link to ensure it activates the next email and works across all supported email clients.
   - Verify that clicking multiple times doesn't cause issues or prevent activation.

9. **Optional Features**:
   - Add a confirmation message prompting the recipient to check their list.
   - Include functionality to reset links at any time.

By following these steps, you'll create a scalable and user-friendly auto-activated email sender that efficiently handles multiple links without complex coding beyond HTML and JavaScript integration.`}</pre></div>;
